//Now lets see if it works! - Retreive some data

-- Retrieve all books and their authors
SELECT books.title, authors.name
FROM books
JOIN authors ON books.author_id = authors.id;

-- Retrieve books published after 2018
SELECT title, published_year
FROM books
WHERE published_year > 2018;

-- Retrieve authors and their book count
SELECT authors.name, COUNT(books.id) AS book_count
FROM authors
LEFT JOIN books ON authors.id = books.author_id
GROUP BY authors.name;

//Naturally it wont be perfect, so here is where you debug, make some updates, etc. 

-- Update the title of Book 1
UPDATE books
SET title = 'New Title'
WHERE id = 1;

-- Delete Book 3
DELETE FROM books
WHERE id = 3;
